# In Game and Daily in Discord Squad Stats

## What it do?
- Posts a Daily Top Player and Server Totals Stats Embed to your Discord at your Configured Time.
- Allow Players to check Stats while in-game with a configurable Cooldown.
- Allow Player to link their in-game and Discord Accounts so that they can:
    - Check Stats in Discord with a configuralbe Cooldown.

## How do the Players use this?
- In-game, players use `!mystats` to view Stats in Game. (or your configured command - don't put an `!` in the config.json)
- In Discord, players use `!link` to get a linking code that is used in game. (or your configured command - don't put an `!` in the config.json).
    - In-game, players use `!link [code]` to link thier in-game to their Discord. (or your configured command - don't put an `!` in the config.json).
- In Discord, once linked, players can use `!mystats` to view thier stats in Discord. (or your configured command - don't put an `!` in the config.json).
    - Players may also use `!mystats [SteamID64]` if they haven't "linked" yet. (or your configured command - don't put an `!` in the config.json).

## Requirements
- DBLog Plugin needs to be ENABLED
- You need to have your Reserve List Configured in `adminLists` if you wish to require in game players to be a Reserve to use the in game Command.

## Further Instructions/Notes for Installing
- You are welcome to use the provided `a-complete-db-log.js` file contents for your `db-log.js` plugin. Just note, that I may not have this file updated as fast if the Main SquadJS updates their version of `db-log.js`.
- Therefore, I have provided the individual bits you need to paste in the `add-to-db-log.js` file.
- You may need to manually update the Database Tables to make sure they get the new Table and Columns:
    - Your Database may/may not be CaSe Sensitive about Table/Columm names.
```sql
ALTER TABLE dblog_players
ADD COLUMN discordID VARCHAR(255);
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE <database name here>.dblog_linkcodes (
    id INT(11) PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    linkCode VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    discordID VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```
- Please contact me if there is any confusion.
